# Restaurant-page-Odin

Few weeks ago i found Odin project as best learning platform for me, i took edx harvard cs50, went to the bunch of tutorials on youtube, learned on scrimba through interactive tutorials, even tried some programming games, but nothing was so good as odin project

---

This project was my practice of using webpack, i made my entire code in JavaScript and made few more js files in components.

My most important files was methods.js in components althrough it took me only while to create, it made my code many times easier to write.
